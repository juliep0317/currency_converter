# Currency Converter Project
## Create a Python script that converts currency using exchange rates stored in a separate module, demonstrating the concept of scope and module usage.

### This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Modules: The exchange_rates.py file serves as a module that stores the exchange rates. The currency_converter.py file imports the exchange_rates module to access the exchange rate variables.
- Scope: The exchange rate variables (USD_TO_EUR, USD_TO_GBP, USD_TO_JPY) are defined within the exchange_rates module and can be accessed from the currency_converter.py script using the module name as a prefix (exchange_rates.USD_TO_EUR). This demonstrates the concept of module-level scope.

In my lesson, I learnt about the concepts of modules and the scope in Python, this project helped me apply those skills in a practical way.
